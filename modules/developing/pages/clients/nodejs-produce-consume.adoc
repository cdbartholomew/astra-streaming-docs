== Pre-req's

You will need the following things in place to complete this guide:

* sudo permission to install dependencies
* Node.js version 10+ and npm 6+
* a working Pulsar topic (xref:getting-started:index.adoc[get started here] if you don't have one)
* a basic text editor or IDE

TIP: Visit our {astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs[examples repo] to see the complete source of this example.

== Setup environment

Before we get started with the app, a little pre-work needs to be done. The Node.js Pulsar client npm package depends on the C++ Pulsar library. First we need to install that dependency.

== Create a project

With the environment dependencies out of the way, let's create a new Node.js project. Run the following script in a terminal. If NPM asks for project values just go with the defaults it suggests.

[source,shell]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/create-project.sh[tag=create-project]
----

== Add the client

A new "index.js" file was created within the project folder. Open that file in your editor of choice and add the following code.

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=create-client]
----

Don't be alarmed if you see error messages in your editor, this is complete code... yet. Notice there are a few variables waiting for a replacement value. Go ahead and fill those in.

== Create a producer

Using that new client instance let's create a producer. While there are quite a few options you have to configure the producer we'll keep it simple and just declare the topic where messages should go.

Add the following code to "index.js".

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=create-producer]
----

Then add this code to actually send the message and receive acknowledgment.

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=produce-message]
----

Also, add a little clean-up to properly handle things.

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=cleanup-producer]
----

== Create a consumer

Now we have a message waiting to be consumed and acknowledged. This code creates a new consumer subscription, declaring what topic to watch and naming the subscription. Add this to "index.js".

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=create-consumer]
----



[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=consume-message]
----

[source,javascript]
----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/SimpleProducerConsumer/index.js[tag=cleanup-consumer]
----

== Run the example

[source,shell]
----
npm run
----

You should see output similar to the following

----
include::{astra-streaming-examples-repo}/nodejs/simple-producer-consumer/output.sh[]
