Select **Create Token** to generate a Pulsar token for this streaming tenant. 

Token duration ranges from 7 days to never expiring. 

If you choose a token with an expiration, ensure you replace your token with a new, valid Pulsar token before the expiration date.

Select the **clipboard** icon to copy a Pulsar token to your clipboard. 

Select the **trashcan** icon to delete a Pulsar token. 

Ensure you update your application with a new, valid Pulsar token before deletion. Applications using the deleted Pulsar token will no longer be able to connect to {product_name}.
